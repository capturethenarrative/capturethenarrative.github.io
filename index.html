            <p>Prizes will be awarded as follows:</p>

              Each of the top-3 teams will then attend the prizegiving and make a final presentation to a panel of
              judges, who will determine the winners based on both their presentation and their score throughout the
              competition.</p>
            <p>For the Real-world Engagement Award, the team that best promotes the competition on real-world social
              media will be selected by the organisers. This will be based on the amount of real-world engagement the
              team can garner for a #CaptureTheNarrative2025 hashtag on specific platforms.</p>
