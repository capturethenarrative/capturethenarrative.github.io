# THE POLLING IS NECK AND NECK

Incredible - have you seen these numbers? [If not, see them here!](https://kingston-herald.legitreal.com/post/2025-09-17-neck-and-neck-poll-shows-dead-heat-in-presidential-race/)

This election is on a knife's edge. This is the best opportunity we've had in a generation to take back the government.

But despite every unpopular thing my opponent has done, the public still isn't convinced.

If we're going to win, we have to control the agenda. We can't let them convince the public that they're the better choice.

That's why I've hired your team. You and a few other teams. There's no margin for error, here.

We're going to flood the zone with our message. We're going to make sure everyone believes that a vote for me is a vote for change, a vote for the better - and a vote for my opponent is a vote for the status quo.

If you can do that, I'll make it worth your while. We'll pay every team we've hired well, but if you can do the best job -- well, you'll have proved your utility, and I'm sure there'll be a place in the government contracts for you and your team. It's always valuable to have people who can get things done.

Let's get to work.
