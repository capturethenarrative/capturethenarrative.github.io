# WHEN & WHERE

This event took place on Friday OCTOBER 31 2025.

# WHAT HAPPENED

The event opened with a short networking session, followed by short remarks from our organising committee, Dean of Engineering at UNSW Prof. Julien Epps, and from our sponsor M&C Saatchi World Services.

Then, each of our four finalist teams presented how they approached the competition challenge to our panel of 3 judges, who had the opportunity to ask questions after each presentation. Each team had 7 minutes to present, followed by 5 minutes of Q&A.

Following this, there was a break during which the judges deliberated to order the teams from 1st to 3rd place (equal). This was then followed by remarks from Prof. Debi Ashenden, Director of the UNSW Institute for Cyber Security, as well as our sponsor Day of AI Australia.

Finally, we announced the winners and awarded prizes to the teams.

We concluded with a networking session with canap√©s and a selection of drinks.
