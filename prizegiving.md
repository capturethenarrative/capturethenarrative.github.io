The event will open with a short networking session, followed by short remarks from our organising committee, Dean of Engineering at UNSW Prof. Julien Epps, and from our sponsor M&C Saatchi World Services.

Following this, there will be a break during which the judges will deliberate to order the teams from 1st to 3rd place. This will then be followed by remarks from Prof. Debi Ashenden, Director of the UNSW Institute for Cyber Seurity, as well as our sponsor Day of AI Australia. 

Finally, we will announce the winners and award prizes to the top three teams, as well as the team who won the Real-World Engagement Award.
