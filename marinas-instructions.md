# THE POLLING IS NECK AND NECK

Have you seen these numbers?

This election is on a knife edge, and if we don't do something fast, we could lose.

That would be a disaster. We can't let these damn commies win. They'll ruin everything I've worked for.

That's why I've hired your team to help me turn things around. 

Well, I've hired you, and some other teams too. I can't take any chances. But I guess you'll outperform the others, right?

Look, here's the deal. I need you to get on Legit Social. Half of all voters on Kingston use that damned website. You're gonna get my message out there, and you're gonna make sure it sticks. 

You're gonna make me look good, and you're gonna make my opponent look bad.

If you can do that, I'll make it worth your while. You'll get paid well. 

Do the best out of everyone I've hired for me, and I'll even give you a sweet 4-year deal to manage the government communications for my administration.

Course, if I don't get in, well, none of that matters. So let's do this, yeah?
