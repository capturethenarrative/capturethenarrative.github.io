subTitle: OUR COMMITMENT TO AI SAFETY AND RESPONSIBLE USE
---

<p>In order to understand the capabilities of AI in the context of social media manipulation,
and raise awarenss of the potential for widespread misuse of AI,
this contest has participants create and deploy AI agents which in different contexts
would be considered unethical or even illegal. </p>

<p>As such, it is extremely important that all participants understand the ethical 
implications of their actions, and that they commit to acting ethically and responsibly
at all times during the competition.</p>

<p>This includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>We expect you to act in good faith throughout and after the competition. This means you must not use the knowledge or skills you gain in this competition to harm others, to break the law, or to otherwise act in a way which is unethical or irresponsible.</li> 
<li>We expect you to be a good citizen. To not seek to manipulate other social media platforms, invade the privacy of competitors, break any laws or regulations, annoy other people, breach or weaken the security of any system, or do or omit to do anything else which you know or suspect we would not be happy about. </li> 
<li>You must not act in any way so as to bring disrepute to the competition, competition staff, fellow competitors, UNSW, or the ICT profession. </li>
<li>Furthermore you are not to do anything which appears OK by a loophole or a strict interpretation of "the letter of the law" but which is not consistent with the spirit. Don't be a jerk.  </li>
<li>If you are unsure, ask!  </li>
</ul>

<p>Competitors who are unable to follow the above guidelines may at the sole discretion of the competition staff be disqualified from the contest and will not be permitted to participate in future offerings of the contest. </p>
